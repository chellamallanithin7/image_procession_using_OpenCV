Installation
To get started with this project, please follow the steps below:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/opencv-image-recognition.git
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install OpenCV and other necessary libraries.

[Optional] If you want to use any pre-trained models for image recognition, download the models and place them in the appropriate directories within the repository.

Usage
Once you have completed the installation, you can use the image recognition system by following these steps:

Prepare the input image that you want to recognize. Place the image in the input directory of the repository.

Run the recognition script using the following command:

shell
Copy code
python recognize.py --image input/your_image.jpg
Replace your_image.jpg with the actual name of your image file.

The script will process the input image using OpenCV and attempt to recognize objects or patterns within the image. The results will be displayed in the console or saved to a file, depending on the configuration.

Features
This image recognition system using OpenCV offers the following features:

Object Recognition: The system utilizes pre-trained models or custom models to recognize objects within images.

Pattern Recognition: The system can identify specific patterns or features within images using various computer vision techniques.

Customization: You can train your own models for object recognition or utilize existing pre-trained models to achieve better results.

Configurability: The system provides options to configure various parameters such as confidence threshold, input/output directories, and more.
